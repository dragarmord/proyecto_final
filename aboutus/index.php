                   <p>Recognized for the friendly staff, welcoming atmosphere and quality of the facilities. You will forget that it's a hostel, as it feels more like a resort.

                   <p>We wanted to give the comfort that a hotel can offer and the experience of meeting other travelers with the same ideas.</p>

                   <p>A mix of private rooms, safari tents and dorms will give you the option to choose according to your budget. Run by costarican's, we've been learning from our guests and sharing every information or advice that could help them in their journey.</p>

                   <p>Our goal has always been to give the best of what a hotel or hostel has to offer. Comfortable rooms with the facilities of a modern hotel and the atmosphere of the best hostel in Central America.</p>

                   <p>In Arenal Backpackers you will be able to sleep well, have a beer by the pool, enjoy the day out in the nature. The open setting of the hostel also makes it the perfect place for meeting fellow travelers.</p>

                   <p>We love what we do, and don't doubt of going out of our way to show you this country and what makes us so proud, but most important to see you leaving with a smile on your face.</p>
